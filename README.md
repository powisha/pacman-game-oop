# Pacman Game (Java)

A simple Pacman game I built in Java to practice object-oriented programming.

The project focuses on implementing character movement, basic game mechanics, and structuring the game using OOP principles.

## What I Worked On

- Player movement and direction handling
- Ghost movement logic
- Collision detection
- Basic game loop structure

## Concepts Used

- Object-Oriented Programming
- Classes & Inheritance
- Game logic structuring in Java

Note: This project was developed and tested in IntelliJ IDEA.
